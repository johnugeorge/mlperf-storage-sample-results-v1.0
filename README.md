# Sample results

This repository demonstrates the expected directory structure required for the MLPerf Storage report generation tool. 


 ## Report generation:

 Follow the instructions provided in [MLPerf Storage](https://github.com/mlcommons/storage#configuration). To generate benchmark submission report,

    ./benchmark.sh reportgen --results-dir runs

This creates the final report named `mlperf_storage_report.json`.
